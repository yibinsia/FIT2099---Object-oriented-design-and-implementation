# FIT2099---Object-oriented-design-and-implementation

This repository contains 3 assignments (progressively increase features) focused on developing a game titled Static Factory, inspired by the popular video game Lethal Company.
 
In these assignments I'm getting familiar with the game engine, SOLID principles and UML/sequence diagram to properly design a Object-Oriented program with JAVA. This project is a collaborative effort completed by myself and three other groupmates.

Assignment 1
- Introduction to basic game mechanics and engine setup.
  
Assignment 2
- Intermediate features, incorporating more complex interactions and system design.
  
Assignment 3
- Advanced gameplay elements, focusing on optimizing performance and refining user experience.
